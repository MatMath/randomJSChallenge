### Renting

First, I hate class and extensions, I prefer way much Functional programming. What come in goes out, Logic. No backward reference to a hidden function.
BUT!!! In order to pass interview I have to know them by hearth and "LOVE" them. Otherwise no job offer.
I use Node, Angular, React daily but no!!! If I don't use extensively Function.prototype.bind.apply(Bob, 4) then I am too stupid to code according to class lover.
But let's make some complex non easily readable code instead :/
