## Well...
That was a flop.
This was a time test to check if I could make a page layout... Well I guess I am bad with Flex. I was able to do it but it took me 1h30m out of 2h so No time to do the final test.  
I don't normally do Webpage, I prefer logic intensive App that have minimal UI. So I spend 90% of the time in Javascript and little playing with the UI.
I normally use Bootstrap and stick with it, but I wanted to use the FlexBox since I did use it a bit this summer. That took me way too much time that I expected to fix it.
